## Hi there, kind stranger! I'm Matteo👋

I'm a Computer Science master's student with a love for structural and pure Mathematics specializing in the following fields:
- Algorithmics 🧩, satisfying my love for puzzles and problem-solving;
- Programming Languages 🧮, one of the most inherently mathematical fields in Computer Science;
- Quantum Computer Science ⚛️, where Computer Science meets my secret love for Physics.

I am currently merging two of these fields in my thesis, namely Algorithmics and Programming Languages, by adding e-graphs to program synthesis. A promising approach for improving efficiency during synthesis. Previously, I explored this intersection in my bachelor's project [PatternPal](https://github.com/PatternPal/PatternPal), a Visual Studio extension that detects design patterns.

I am fascinated by the differences between programming languages, especially how their unique features help to solve different problems. Rust’s emphasis on memory safety without a garbage collector, Haskell's strong type system and functional paradigm, Python’s simplicity and readability, and even MiniZinc's declarative distinctness.

Embedded programming is a hobby of mine, where low-level programming meets hardware. I satisfy this hobby by [developing a satellite with Da Vinci Satellite](https://github.com/davincisatellite), and with personal projects like this [smart clock](https://github.com/ViciousDoormat/Smart-clock).
