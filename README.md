## Hi there, kind stranger! I'm Matteo👋

I'm a Computer Science master student with a love for Mathematics specializing in the following fields:
- Algorithmics 🧩, satisfying my love for puzzles and problem-solving;
- Programming Languages 🧮, one of the most inherently mathematical fields in Computer Science;
- Quantum Computer Science ⚛️, where Computer Science meets my secret love for Physics.

I am merging two of these fields in my thesis, namely Algorithmics and Programming Languages, by adding e-graphs to program synthesis.
