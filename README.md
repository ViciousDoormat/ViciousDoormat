## Hi there, kind stranger! I'm Matteo👋

I recently finished my Computer Science master at the TU Delft, where I specialized in the following fields:
- Algorithmics 🧩, satisfying my love for puzzles and problem-solving;
- Programming Languages 🧮, one of the most inherently mathematical fields in Computer Science;
- Quantum Computer Science ⚛️, where Computer Science meets my secret love for Physics.

My [master thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:9985f65b-37ef-42ca-80e2-dabb995d444e) merged two of these fields, namely Algorithmics and Programming Languages, by performing program synthesis with E-Graphs. A promising approach for improving efficiency during synthesis. 

Previously, I explored this intersection in my bachelor's project [PatternPal](https://github.com/PatternPal/PatternPal), a Visual Studio extension that detects design patterns.

I am fascinated by the differences between programming languages, especially how their unique features help to solve different problems. For example, I love Rust’s emphasis on memory safety without a garbage collector, Haskell's functional purity and it's ability to guide the compiler, and Python’s simplicity and readability.

Embedded programming is a hobby of mine, where low-level programming meets hardware. I satisfy this hobby by [developing a satellite with Da Vinci Satellite](https://github.com/davincisatellite), and with personal projects like this [smart clock](https://github.com/ViciousDoormat/Smart-clock).
